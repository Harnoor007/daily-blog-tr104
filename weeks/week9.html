                    <p>Today I was introduced to my main project for the remainder of my training period - the Super Admin Portal.</p>
                    <p>Activities:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Attended the project kickoff meeting with the team</li>
                        <li>Received an overview of the Super Admin Portal project</li>
                        <li>Discussed the project's purpose and importance for Wits Innovation Lab</li>
                        <li>Took notes on the main features and modules required</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Project Overview:</p>
                    <p>The Super Admin Portal will be an internal tool for Wits to manage their software products, clients, and subscriptions. It will help track which clients are using which products, manage pricing plans, and handle invoicing. I'll be working as a backend developer using Node.js, TypeScript, and MongoDB.</p>

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-calendar-check"></i> Day 2 - Tuesday</h3>
                    <p>Today we delved deeper into the project requirements and started planning the database structure.</p>
                    <p>Activities:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Analyzed the detailed requirements document</li>
                        <li>Identified the main entities needed for the database</li>
                        <li>Started drafting initial schema designs for products, plans, and cycles</li>
                        <li>Discussed potential challenges and approaches with my mentor</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Key Insights:</p>
                    <p>The database design will be crucial for this project. We need to create flexible schemas that can accommodate different product types, pricing plans, and subscription cycles. The relationships between these entities will be complex and require careful planning.</p>

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-calendar-check"></i> Day 3 - Wednesday</h3>
                    <p>Today we focused on understanding the client module requirements and planning the API structure.</p>
                    <p>Activities:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Analyzed client management requirements</li>
                        <li>Drafted the client schema with necessary fields</li>
                        <li>Planned the RESTful API endpoints for client management</li>
                        <li>Discussed how clients will be linked to products and subscriptions</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Key Decisions:</p>
                    <p>We decided to use a comprehensive client schema that includes contact information, billing details, and subscription history. The API will support all CRUD operations plus additional functionality for activating/deactivating clients and managing their subscriptions.</p>

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-calendar-check"></i> Day 4 - Thursday</h3>
                    <p>Today we explored the invoicing requirements and started planning the project structure.</p>
                    <p>Activities:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Analyzed the invoicing module requirements</li>
                        <li>Researched PDF generation and email sending in Node.js</li>
                        <li>Planned the project folder structure and architecture</li>
                        <li>Set up the initial project repository</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Technical Decisions:</p>
                    <p>We decided to use a modular architecture with separate controllers for each main feature. For PDF generation, we'll explore libraries like PDFKit or html-pdf. For email functionality, we'll use Nodemailer. The project will follow a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns.</p>

                    <p>Today we finalized the project plan and prepared for development to begin next week.</p>
                    <p>Activities:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Created a detailed project roadmap with milestones</li>
                        <li>Set up the development environment with Node.js, TypeScript, and MongoDB</li>
                        <li>Initialized the project with necessary dependencies</li>
                        <li>Created the basic Express server structure</li>
                        <li>Had a final planning meeting with the team</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Next Steps:</p>
                    <p>Starting next week, I'll begin implementing the core functionality of the Super Admin Portal. The first task will be to set up the database connection and create the initial schemas for products, plans, and cycles. Then I'll develop the basic CRUD operations for these entities.</p>
                    <p>End of week reflection: This week has been exciting as I've been introduced to a real-world project that will utilize all the skills I've learned so far. The Super Admin Portal is a complex application with many interconnected parts, but breaking it down into modules makes it more manageable. I'm looking forward to applying my Node.js and TypeScript knowledge to build a robust backend for this system. The planning phase has been valuable for understanding the full scope of the project before diving into development.</p>
