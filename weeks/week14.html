                    <p>End of week reflection: This week I successfully implemented the dashboard and analytics features for the Super Admin Portal. The APIs now provide valuable insights into client behavior, product performance, and revenue trends. I learned a lot about MongoDB aggregation pipelines and how to efficiently calculate metrics from related collections. The caching mechanism I implemented will ensure that the dashboard loads quickly, even as the amount of data in the system grows. These analytics features will help Wits Innovation Lab make data-driven decisions about their products and client relationships.</p>
