                    <p>Set up the testing environment and planned the testing strategy.</p>
                    <p>Tasks completed:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Configured Jest with TypeScript support</li>
                        <li>Set up test database configuration</li>
                        <li>Created test utilities and helpers</li>
                        <li>Planned test coverage targets for different modules</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Challenges faced:</p>
                    <p>Setting up Jest with TypeScript and MongoDB required careful configuration. I needed to ensure that tests ran in isolation and that the test database was properly seeded with test data and cleaned up after each test run.</p>

                        <li>Added tests for permission checking utilities</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Challenges faced:</p>
                    <p>Writing effective unit tests required careful consideration of edge cases and boundary conditions. I needed to ensure that tests were focused on specific functionality and not dependent on implementation details that might change.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Challenges faced:</p>
                    <p>Testing the complex relationships between products, plans, and clients required careful setup of test data. I needed to ensure that the tests verified not only the direct changes but also the cascade effects on related entities.</p>

                        <li>Added tests for email sending functionality (with mocks)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Challenges faced:</p>
                    <p>Testing components with external dependencies like PDF generation and email sending required effective mocking. I needed to create mock implementations that accurately simulated these services without actually generating PDFs or sending emails during tests.</p>

                    <p>End of week reflection: This week was focused on ensuring the quality and reliability of the Super Admin Portal through comprehensive testing. I've learned a lot about effective testing strategies for Node.js applications with MongoDB. Setting up Jest with TypeScript provided a robust testing environment, and writing tests for different modules helped identify and fix several edge cases that might have caused issues in production. The improved error handling will make the application more resilient, and the continuous integration setup will ensure that tests are run automatically with each code change. While we haven't achieved 100% test coverage yet, we've established a solid foundation that can be built upon in the future.</p>
