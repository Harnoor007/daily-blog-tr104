                    <p>This week is dedicated to revision and self-exploration. Today I focused on reviewing JavaScript fundamentals.</p>
                    <p>Activities:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reviewed JavaScript basics (variables, data types, operators)</li>
                        <li>Practiced with arrays and array methods</li>
                        <li>Revisited functions and scope concepts</li>
                        <li>Created small code challenges to test my understanding</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Reflections:</p>
                    <p>Going back to the fundamentals helped solidify my understanding. I realized I was much more comfortable with these concepts now than when I first learned them. Creating my own small challenges was a good way to test my knowledge.</p>

                    <p>Today I focused on revising TypeScript concepts that I learned in the previous weeks.</p>
                    <p>Activities:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reviewed TypeScript types and interfaces</li>
                        <li>Practiced with type annotations in various scenarios</li>
                        <li>Explored the TypeScript documentation for deeper understanding</li>
                        <li>Converted some of my JavaScript projects to TypeScript</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Reflections:</p>
                    <p>Converting existing JavaScript code to TypeScript was a great exercise. It helped me understand the benefits of static typing more clearly. I found some edge cases where TypeScript's type system really shines in catching potential errors.</p>

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-calendar-check"></i> Day 3 - Wednesday</h3>
                    <p>Today I revisited Node.js and Express concepts, focusing on creating a small project from scratch.</p>
                    <p>Activities:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Set up a new Node.js project with npm</li>
                        <li>Created a simple Express server with multiple routes</li>
                        <li>Implemented middleware for logging and error handling</li>
                        <li>Connected the application to MongoDB</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Reflections:</p>
                    <p>Building a project from scratch without following specific instructions was challenging but rewarding. It helped me identify areas where I needed more practice, particularly in structuring the application in a maintainable way. I'm getting more comfortable with the Express.js workflow.</p>

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-calendar-check"></i> Day 4 - Thursday</h3>
                    <p>Today I explored some topics that I was curious about but weren't covered in depth during the training.</p>
                    <p>Activities:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Learned about GraphQL as an alternative to REST APIs</li>
                        <li>Explored WebSockets for real-time communication</li>
                        <li>Researched different deployment options for Node.js applications</li>
                        <li>Studied best practices for securing Node.js applications</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Reflections:</p>
                    <p>Exploring these additional topics helped broaden my understanding of the Node.js ecosystem. I'm particularly interested in WebSockets and how they can be used for real-time features. The security best practices were eye-opening and something I want to incorporate into my future projects.</p>

                    <p>On the final day of my revision week, I created a personal learning roadmap and reviewed my progress so far.</p>
                    <p>Activities:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reviewed all my notes from the previous weeks</li>
                        <li>Identified strengths and areas for improvement</li>
                        <li>Created a personal learning roadmap for continued growth</li>
                        <li>Prepared questions to discuss with my mentor in the coming weeks</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Reflections:</p>
                    <p>This week of revision and exploration has been extremely valuable. It gave me time to process everything I've learned so far and to fill in any gaps in my understanding. I feel more confident in my abilities and have a clearer picture of where I want to focus my efforts going forward. Having this break to consolidate knowledge was just what I needed before diving into new topics.</p>
                    <p>End of week reflection: Taking this week to review, practice, and explore has significantly strengthened my understanding of JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js. Self-directed learning helped me discover my own learning style and identify areas where I need more practice. I'm looking forward to applying this refreshed knowledge in the coming weeks of my training.</p>
