                    <h3>Current Focus</h3>
                    <p>This week, I focused on implementing a comprehensive role-based access control (RBAC) system for the Super Admin Portal to ensure secure access to different features based on user roles.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Key Features Implemented</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>User authentication and authorization system</li>
                        <li>Role and permission management</li>
                        <li>User invitation and onboarding process</li>
                        <li>Integration of access control across all APIs</li>
                        <li>User activity tracking and audit logs</li>

                        <li>Set up basic user management endpoints</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Challenges faced:</p>
                    <p>Designing a flexible permission system that could accommodate all the different actions in the application required careful planning. I needed to ensure that permissions were granular enough without becoming too complex to manage.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Challenges faced:</p>
                    <p>Ensuring the security of the authentication system was paramount. I had to implement proper password hashing, secure token handling, and protection against common security vulnerabilities.</p>

                    <p>Developed the role and permission management system.</p>
                    <p>Tasks completed:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Created predefined roles (Global Admin, Finance, Basic User)</li>
                        <li>Implemented permission assignment to roles</li>
                        <li>Developed API endpoints for role management</li>
                        <li>Created middleware for permission checking</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Challenges faced:</p>
                    <p>Determining the appropriate permissions for each role required discussions with stakeholders. I also needed to ensure that the permission checking middleware was efficient and wouldn't significantly impact API performance.</p>

                    <p>Challenges faced:</p>
                    <p>Managing the invitation process and ensuring that only valid invitations could be used to create accounts required careful validation. I also needed to handle the bulk import of employee data efficiently while maintaining data integrity.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>End of week reflection: This week I successfully implemented a comprehensive role-based access control system for the Super Admin Portal. The system now ensures that users can only access features appropriate to their role, and all actions are properly tracked and audited. Integrating this security layer across all existing APIs was challenging but essential for maintaining data security. The user invitation system provides a streamlined way to onboard new staff members while maintaining security. I've learned a lot about authentication, authorization, and security best practices during this implementation.</p>
