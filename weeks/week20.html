                    <p>End of week reflection: This final week marks the completion of the Super Admin Portal project, which has been my main focus during the industrial training at Wits Innovation Lab. Over the past 12 weeks, I've developed a comprehensive system that allows Wits to manage their products, clients, subscriptions, and invoicing. The project has grown from a simple concept to a robust application with features including dashboard analytics, automated invoice generation, role-based access control, and more.</p>
                    
                    <p>Looking back on this journey, I've gained invaluable experience in backend development with Node.js, TypeScript, and MongoDB. I've learned how to design complex database schemas, implement secure authentication systems, create reusable packages, optimize performance, and write comprehensive tests. The challenges I faced, particularly with complex data relationships and calculating billing adjustments, pushed me to grow as a developer.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Super Admin Portal will help Wits Innovation Lab manage their product offerings more efficiently, track client subscriptions, and automate much of their invoicing process. I'm proud of what I've accomplished during this training period and grateful for the opportunity to work on a real-world project with meaningful impact.</p>
